Hello. My name is Stanislav Belchuk. In the future, I may enjoy being a computer programmer because I am keen on trying computer techniques and working with computers is always fun and exciting for me.

People with jobs in the career field of IT use computers, software, networks, servers, and other technology to manage and store data. There is growing demand  in various jobs in the field of information technologies nowadays.

It is important to understand that the work of the programmer can be different: some of them work for a small agency, some for a huge company, others are freelance or have their own business. I’d like to work for a big company.

In order to be a successful IT specialist you must possess some skills and personal qualities. The most important ones are the following: being able to think logically, love to solve problems, persistence and patience. A computer programmer must be able to find the most efficient way to solve the problem.

I want my future job be interesting and well-paid. People say that money isn’t everything, but it certainly does help because it gives independence and freedom.  I’d like to combine a good satisfying job with a high paying salary.
